# SlackOff
The goal of SlackOff is to have an ever increasing number of useful Slack tools. These tools will be available by calling SlackOff's chat bot with commands associated with certain tools. The first tool in development is a simple navigation tool which allows a user to revert the chat back to the moment they were last online. This allows the user to read any and all messages they may have missed. As tools are finished this readme will be editted to show finished tools, in progress tools, and planned tools.

# In Progress
